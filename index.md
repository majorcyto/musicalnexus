## Musical Nexus

Musical Nexus is now "retired" and the main website is no longer available, an Archive version of the website has taken it's place.

You can still interact with our community via our Discord Server which is found below, the Discord is NOT being deleted and will remain available.

Also due to some wonderful community members namely Grabo with some early help from Champ4now we also have complete archive exports of each Music Hall which can be downloaded below. The archives are mirrored on 3 sites for availability.

## Music Hall Archive Downloads

Thanks to our community member Grabo, we have full exports of the Mabinogi Music Hall and the Musical Nexus Music Hall! They come in two versions, a raw JSON format (Raw Code) as well as a HTML format that you can open in your browser locally on your computer. Grabo even took some extra steps and made it so you can search and filter on the HTML page to help you find what you are looking for.

**Compatibility Notice**: The HTML version of the archive will only allow you to save files on newer versions of Browsers. Any Chromium Browser (Chrome, Brave, New Edge, Etc) will work, as well as recent versions of Firefox. Older versions of Firefox, Old Edge, and Normal Internet Explorer will not prompt the save dialog box when running the HTML file locally on your computer.

For most users we recommend downloading the HTML versions. Once you download the file, UNZIP the zip file FIRST. Then inside the folder you unzipped look for the "index.html" file and open it in one of the working browsers mentioned above in the previous paragraph.
